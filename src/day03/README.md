### Day 3: Data types

Java is a statically-typed language, which means that all variables must first be declared before they can be used. This involves stating the variable's type and name, as you've seen already:


```java
int myNumber = 5;
String myString = "Hello";
```

In the above example,
*  `int` and `String` are Java ***data types***,
*  `myNumber` and `myString` are ***variable names***, and 
*  `5` and `"Hello"` are the values assigned to the ***variables***.

Here are some commonly used data types in Java:

**Primitive Data Types:**

1.  `byte`: This data type is used to save space in large arrays, mainly in place of integers, since a `byte` is four times smaller than an `int`. Example: `byte a = 10;`
    
2.  `short`: This type is used to save memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually matters. Example: `short s = 20;`
    
3.  `int`: This is generally used as the default data type for integral values unless there is a concern about memory. Example: `int i = 30;`
    
4.  `long`: This type is used when a wider range than `int` is needed. Example: `long l = 400000L;`
    
5.  `float`: This is used to save memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers. Example: `float f = 20.5f;`
    
6.  `double`: This is generally used as the default data type for decimal values. Example: `double d = 20.5;`
    
7.  `boolean`: This is used for flags that track true/false conditions. Example: `boolean b = true;`
    
8.  `char`: This is used to store characters. Example: `char letter = 'A';`
    

**Non-primitive Data Types (Reference/Object Data Types):**

These are used to access objects. They are also used to access methods that can perform certain operations on objects. The `String` data type is one of the most commonly used non-primitive data types. Example: `String s = "Hello, Java!";`

**Type Conversion:**

Sometimes it's necessary to convert data from one type to another. This can be done in two ways:

1.  **Implicit conversion:** If the two types are compatible, and the target type is larger than the source type, Java will perform an automatic type conversion. For example, you can assign an `int` value to a `long` variable without casting it because `long` is larger than `int`.


```java
int i = 100;
long l = i;  // No explicit casting required here
``` 

2.  **Explicit conversion:** If the two types are not compatible, or the target type is smaller than the source type, you'll need to perform an explicit conversion.


```java
double d = 100.04;
long l = (long)d; // Explicit casting is required here
```

This brief overview introduces you to data types in Java and how you can manipulate them. Next, we'll look at Java's structure and syntax, which allows you to create complex programs.
