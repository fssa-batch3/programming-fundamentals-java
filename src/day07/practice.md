## Practice Questions

1.  Write a Java program that reads an integer from the user. If the number is positive, print "The number is positive." If the number is negative, print "The number is negative." If the number is zero, print "The number is zero."
    
2.  Write a Java program that reads a character from the user. If the character is a vowel, print "The character is a vowel." If the character is a consonant, print "The character is a consonant." Make sure to handle both upper and lower case letters.
    
3.  Write a Java program that reads an integer (1-7) representing the day of the week from the user. Use a `switch` statement to print the name of the day (1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, etc.). If the number is not between 1 and 7, print "Invalid day."
